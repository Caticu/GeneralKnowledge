# GeneralKnowledge

I always liked "Who wants to be a millionaire?" tv show or any other kind of general knowledge quiz. To get to the university I spend 1 hour on transportation on the train. This time wasted can 
actually, be productive. 
For my Android re-exam application, I decided to make an app that would ask me general knowledge questions. This way my rides to university would be way more interesting. I can learn a lot of new things
and test my knowledge.
