# GeneralKnowledge

I always liked "Who wants to be a millionaire?" tv show or any other kind of general knowledge quizzes. To get to the university I spend 1 hour on transportation in the train. This time wasted can 
actually be productive. 
For my Android re-exam application I decided to make an app that would ask me general knowledge questions. This way my rides to university would be way more interesting. I can learn a lot of new things
and test my knowledge.
